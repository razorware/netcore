# .NetCore Toolbox  

.NetCore Toolbox is a .NetCore (v.2.0) library with various items that I find useful or have chosen to experiment with. Many of the items are unfinished but may be stubbed in a way to help me remember what I was doing with particular items.

Feel free to use this library in part or full, modified to your needs.

If you would like to contribute, send an email to: david@boarman.net.

There are bugs here and there. This software available with the acknowledgement that it is 'as-is'.

# Logger
I would like to get some help with the logger and implementing the formatter. It would also be nice to have multiple output media.
