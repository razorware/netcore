This is where I am working on a Proxy framework.

# NOTES:
## _Dynamics_ Namespace - 

* DynamicsExtensions.cs - 
  Like the `DataExtensions` API, I employ similar fluent development with heavy use of delegates. Please take the time to understand the language generator as well as how delegates work.

  I have some very cool ideas (plans) for proxies in an RYO micro-ORM using objects from the `Data` namespace.
