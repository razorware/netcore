Nothing special here but a few worded ramblings about nonsensical stuff like how the cow really did
jump over the moon and, since Jack fell over the candlestick he couldn't have been that nimble. Maybe
Jack was quick but I don't think it really matters. We are not sure how bad Jack hurt himself but I
don't expect nimbleness will be a trait for which he is known.
